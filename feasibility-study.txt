1. General rules

1.1. Pieces are in superposition state, described as '*'.
1.2. At the beginning *=king|queen|rook|bishop|knight|pawn.
1.3. Dirac notation will not be used as too complex for people not exposed to quantum theory.
1.4. Player has the same amount of given pieces as in regular game of chess. One king, one queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, eight pawns. Superposition means that it is unclear which one is which kind. It does not mean that players pieces can become for example fourteen queens.
1.5. Pieces collapse from superposition towards defined state by their movement.
1.6. Every piece in superposition state can move as any piece it can finally become.
1.7. Movement must be historically accurate.

Example 1:
Piece p1=king|queen|rook|bishop|knight|pawn moved two squares up and one square left. Only knight can do it so this piece immediately collapses to its final state - knight.

Example 2:
Piece p1=king|queen|rook|bishop|knight|pawn moved three squares up. Only queen and rook can do it so this piece collapses to queen|rook. The same piece moved one square diagonally. From queen|rook only queen can do it so this piece collapses to its final state - queen.

1.8. Sum of different states in collapsed or partially collapsed pieces multiplied by maximum amount 
of corresponding types pieces cannot be greater or equal to total amount of collapsed or partially collapsed pieces. 

Example 3:
Collapse in Example 2 led to state: p1=queen.
Distinct possible states are: queen.
Amount of collapsed or partially collapsed pieces is: 1
One allowed queen is equal to 1 collapsed piece.
That means no other piece can become queen and must collapse to *=king|rook|bishop|knight|pawn.

1.9. Multiple collapses are possible:

Example 4:
Three pieces king|queen|rook|bishop|knight|pawn moved diagonally 4 squares each.
Only queen and bishop can do it so they collapsed to:
p1=queen|bishop
p2=queen|bishop
p3=queen|bishop
This causes further collapsing defined in 1.8.  
Distinct states are: queen|bishop.
Amount of collapsed pieces is: 3.
Possible final collapses are: queen * 1, bishop bishop * 2.
That means no other piece can become queen or bishop and must collapose to *=king|rook|knight|pawn.
Now p1 moves one square up. From queen|bishop only queen can do it so p1 collapses to queen.
That means p2 ans p3 cannot become queen and collapse to bishops.
